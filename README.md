### [Covid Cases](https://7cbiqh-theglucru.shinyapps.io/covid_cases/)

- As a healthcare professional, I naturally found myself naturally tracking the COVID-19 cases in the US. Working in a public setting, I try to keep myself educated on the this topic and track how well the country is doing

- Includes total number of cases, deaths, and reported new cases and deaths.

- Data is based on [The New York Times Dataset](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)


### [TTStarbucks](https://7cbiqh-theglucru.shinyapps.io/SBuxDrinks/)

- Comparision of 2 drinks, with size, milk, and whipped cream, formatted to look as closely as a nutrition label as possible
